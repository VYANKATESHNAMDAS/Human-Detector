# üîê Human-Detector System using ESP32-CAM | Face Recognition + Telegram Alert üì∑üì©

This project is a smart security solution that uses the **ESP32-CAM** module to detect motion using a **PIR sensor**, perform **face recognition**, and send an alert image to **Telegram** if an **unknown face** is detected.

## üìå Features

- üì∏ Motion Detection using PIR Sensor
- üß† Face Recognition using ESP32-CAM
- üì§ Automatic alert photo sent to Telegram
- üí° Optimized for low power and real-time use
- üì∂ Wi-Fi based communication

## üîê Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- ESP32 Board Package ([Installation Guide](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/))
- Libraries:
  - `WiFi.h`
  - `WiFiClientSecure.h`
  - `esp_camera.h`
  - `UniversalTelegramBot`
  - `esp32_face_recognition.h` *(or custom face matching logic)*

## ü§ñ How It Works

1. The PIR sensor detects motion.
2. ESP32-CAM captures an image.
3. The captured face is checked against known faces.
4. If the face is **unknown**, the image is sent to your **Telegram bot**.
5. You receive a live alert with a photo on your phone.

## üì± Telegram Bot Setup

1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`
2. Send `/newbot` and follow the instructions to get your `BOT_TOKEN`
3. Start the bot and use this URL to find your `chat_id`:
